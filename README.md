## Introduction

Discapp is a Node.js framework for rapidly building Discord applications (bots) using latest JavaScript features and TypeScript.

While most of Discord libraries only exposes methods for interacting with the Discord API, Discapp was designed to make easy to write fancy Discord applications by getting rid of the boring parts:

- Command routing
- Message parsing and validation
- Permission/roles handling
- Command documentation
